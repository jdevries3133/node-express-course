# Summary

[Lesson page](https://learn.codethedream.org/ctd-node-express-class-lesson-5-task-manager-api-part-1/)

Students do part 1 of the Task Manager API (a classic TODO app). They scaffold
out the project, wrestle with connecting to a MongoDB database for the first
time. This week is heavy on the project setup and methods to query the
database. In part 2, students will finish building out the API

Pay special attention to `quizAnswers.txt`, which has students' responses to
some open-ended questions.

Also watch that students have not committed their `.env` file to their
repository. Students are using MongoDB atlas, so leaked credentials are a
serious concern here.
