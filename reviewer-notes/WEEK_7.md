> This is a difficult lesson, so take your time with it...

This week, students finish the Store API assignment (04).

Note that students' PRs will probably have the contents of this week and the
previous week combined.

The diff for this week is actually very small as far as I can tell, there is
not much to indicate students' understanding or lack thereof. I would probably
like to amend to these notes with more detail... Looking forward to hearing
others' input.
