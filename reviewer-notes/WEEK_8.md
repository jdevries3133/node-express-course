# Lesson 8: JWT Basics

[Lesson page](https://learn.codethedream.org/ctd-node-express-class-lesson-8-jwt-basics-a/)

Students are presented with two extra assignments:

1. Create a new Express app with JWT auth from scratch (from written
   instructions)
2. Following along with the video exactly

If students do the "preferred" assignment (#1), they will put it in
`05-JWT-Basics/preferred`. Otherwise, their work will be in
`05-JWT-Basics/starter`.

If students do the preferred assignment, compare their work to the written
instructions; expect to spend more focus on the code review.

If students do the starter assignment, you can copy and paste their work into
the final directory, and then view the resultant diff to get a narrower focus
on what, if anything, they changed compared to what the instructor
demonstrated.
