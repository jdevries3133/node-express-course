# Summary

[Lesson page](https://learn.codethedream.org/ctd-node-express-class-lesson-4-middleware-rest-methods-and-postman/)

Students finish the Express tutorial they started last week. You should expect
the following modules to be completed:

- 08-middleware-basic.js
- 09-middleware-use.js
- 10-middleware-options.js
- 11-methods.js
- 12-route-app.js
- routes/people.js
- routes/auth.js
- controllers/people.js

## Additional Assignment: Practice Middleware

This additional assignment is found in `practice-middleware.js`, and it is not
part of the video tutorial. Make sure it's completed! Also, give it a closer
look, since students are applying their knowledge from instructions rather than
rote following, so there's a change that there will be an opportunity to
provide more meaningful feedback.
