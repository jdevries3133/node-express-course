npm -- global command, comes with node
npm --version :to check the version
local dependency :use it only in this one project
to install?
--> npm i <packageName>

global dependency? use it in any project
to install?
--> npm install -g <packageName>


package.json - manifest file(stores important info about project/package)

we installed lodash just to see if we could!
it is in the package.json, go check it out
could also:
npm i bootstrap
but we don't need it, so we didn'the

VERY IMPORTANT packages are dependencies

added nodemon to help with the server with:
--> npm i nodemon -D (adds it as a devDependency)
or could npm i nodemon --save-dev
--> we didn't install nodemon globally. LET'S!

go to the terminal and install it as sudo.
Or, put the below code line into the bash:
 npm install -g nodemon


let's fo set up a server start command:
in package.json, go to the scripts and see what we added.

can:
npm uninstall bootstrap

TO START NODEMON, MY COMMAND IN PACKAGE.JSON IS:
    nodemon utils.js in the terminal

global packages can cause a lot of problems for you
super glad I found that out after I installed it ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ 

as the versions change, we need to stay up to date if possible to aviod bugs
for the rest of the course, we'll be spinning up our
servers with nodemon

This is jsut an overview, but to really understand, BUILD!
