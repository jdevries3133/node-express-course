//after we add john's line from above, we now have a decent page to use
//without a small working app like this, we could use postman. go your HTML file and check out the form.

//sending the form without a route to handle the post login will create an error. 
//in the network tab we can look in headers and see our method. It was not get, it was post. 
//all the way at the bottom, we can see the key value of the body. IT IS CRUCIAL to add a post method if sending a body!

//what we put into the form is our key. "Peter", "John" are the keys.
