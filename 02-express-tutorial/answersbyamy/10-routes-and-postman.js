//let's check with JS to send the user a message and make sure they are not submitting an empty form. we can check of the front end for sure! But we are learning how to do it here on the server. 

//lets try the js version on the front end. look at the js.html file. there is no method 


//cool, we posted it, but now, we don't really have access to anything we sent. Find a way to fix that
//use the MW!
//use urlencoded MW in the app.use above. pass in the express kv
//the extended false has to do with how we pass in query strings
//editing my above /login route to show another option for it now that we have theMW

//in the js.html, you can see we are using axios with a cdn link. 
//axios, in the js.html is GETting the same api/people route. 
//we are sending the value with axios syntax to send info as a key/value pair. 
//if we are submitting an empty form, we will show an error message.

//FOCUS AND REMEMBER----> an app.get('api/people') IS NOT THE SAME AS AN app.post('api/people')
//Just because the url's are the same, they don't mean the same thing!
//The method is diff. With app.get, we are just reading the data from api/people
//with app.post, we are actually adding the data.
//201 is the response code for success.


//app.use is applying MW to all of our routes. use the methods/public folder here

//setting up a front end to test every server route we make is time consuming-we will use Postman as an alternative.
//I already have it set up and have used it before
