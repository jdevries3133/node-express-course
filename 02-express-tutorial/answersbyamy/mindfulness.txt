1. Yes!  I just had a huge "aha" moment today, and I just sat and enjoyed it for a second. Backend has always been such a weakness for me. But I'm currently in a full stack software engineer fellowship AND Code The Dream. 

Today, I was tasked with setting up a database from classes and then creating routes in a server file in Python, Flask and PostgreSQL. I have been working on this asssignment for CTD over the last week. Everytime I get the server to actually run and do what is expected, I get such a thrill. But once my Python server was up, running and doing what it should be- I was elated. 

I know for sure that CTD has directly helped me succeed in my fellowship these last few weeks. Small details that make such a huge difference, even with something like HTTP methods have been reinforced for me. (Also things like a data route vs a page route, reading the messages in the console that accompany what we send).

The hardest part for me personally is still extracting info between objects and then into their file.

2.What was I worried about before class started? Never successfully getting a server to run that I had built. I had watched many tutorials but could never quite get it right. Shockingly now, if someone asks for a server, I could reply "Do you want that in Flask and Python? Or Node and JS?" Definitely not a massive server, but just being able to do that at this point is incredible to me.

3. I feel hopeful. I am transitioning into the role of software engineer because it fulfills what I've been lacking in my careers so far-I want to spend my career learning, growing, and engineering cool stuff that makes a difference. So I feel hopeful!
