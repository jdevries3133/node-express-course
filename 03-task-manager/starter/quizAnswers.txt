1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

Ans: 
-Middleware is a function that processes a request, which can either come from the browser or another function. 
-It also has a next function which when invoked will execute the next middleware succeeding the current one.
-It can be applied to multiple Express paths, rather than adding the same call back function code at multiple places,
and we can also load multiple stack of middlewares at the same path.
-We can use the middleware for protected routing and error handling in Express. 


2. What does CRUD stand for?
Ans:
-Create, Read, Update and Destroy/Delete.

3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.

1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
Ans - To access the information in the .env file, which is stored as key=value pair, we pass the name prefixed with 
process.env inplace of the value stored in the .env file where applicable eg: process.env.NAME
Also we require dotenv package to read the env file and invoke the config. eg: require('dotenv'),config();

2. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?
We should add the .env file to our .gitignore file so its not stored in the git when we commit and push our code.
